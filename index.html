		Hey there! I'm professional graphic designer. I'm really a simple girl but damn passionate about learn something new.<br><b>Specially I love to use technology</b>. Computer is the first thing in my mind always.<br> I've started web design and development course under LEDP. <br>Starting session is quite difficult for me because, I've no basic knowledge about this.<br> Our benevolent sir <u><b> Tasin Arnab</b></u>, he's really dedicated person. <br>Although, I'm beginner but he’s lectures are so clear so that it’s easy to catch.<br> Hope best for my next classes. Keep me in your prayers.<br>Greetings..
